# 🌌 TENSOR THROTTLE X

> **Not a portfolio. Not a showcase. A raw cognitive space.**

This is an experimental laboratory for externalizing unpolished thought. It is a system built to process raw ideas, document technical failures, and map the evolution of reasoning before it solidifies into a final product.

---

## 🧠 Core Ideology

*   **Raw over Polished**: We value the messy, chaotic process of creation over the sanitized final output.
*   **Evolution over Perfection**: This space is for things that are growing, changing, and often breaking.
*   **Thinking in Public**: A dimensional structure to make abstract, fleeting thoughts tangible and navigable.

## 🏛️ Architecture

*   **Layer 0: Atmosphere** - Cinematic, looping visuals that set a cognitive tone.
*   **Layer 1: Structure** - Glass-morphism overlays providing a substrate for content.
*   **Layer 2: Cognition** - The actual data: fragmented notes, code snippets, and evolving systems.

## 🛠️ The Stack

*   **Next.js 16** (App Router)
*   **Tailwind CSS 4.0**
*   **Notion CMS** (Raw thought repository)
*   **Supabase** (Engagement & persistence)

## 🚀 Setup

1.  Clone.
2.  `pnpm install`
3.  Set `.env.local` (Notion & Supabase keys).
4.  `pnpm dev`

*Built for the process, not the result.*
